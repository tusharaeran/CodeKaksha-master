# CodeKaksha


Hello. I(Taj Sapra) am working on a website for coders. Here u can learn, ask doubts, use ide for practice, give contributions like testimonials and blogs.
I have implemented a major part of it.
I have removed node js modules and the api tokens for both login features and compiler api, please use your own.
I have used:
  1) HTML(EJS), CSS, Javascript for frontend
  2) Mongo db for database
  3) Express and NodeJs for backend

Here is a link to the flowchart for various functionalities of the website:
